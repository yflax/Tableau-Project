# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
> For this project I chose to work with option 1 and gain insight into trends and patters of Canadian real estate prices through visualizations. My goal is to find the most appropriate visualization to answer each question so that the visualization itself can explain data without needing much explanation.  
I hope that once I've completed this project I will become knowledgeable about Tableau visualizations and the Canadian real-estate market  .

## Process
### 1) EXPLORING & UPLOADING THE DATA  
After downloading the real-estate files locally , I read them to familiarize myself with the various fields. I then uploaded them to Tableau.

### (your step 2)

## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
